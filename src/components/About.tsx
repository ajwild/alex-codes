      <h3>Hello, how do you do?</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Alex Wild and I am a full stack JavaScript developer living
        in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. I enjoy working as a full stack developer, from
        provisioning servers all the way up to getting the user interface
        pixel-perfect, as the variety of work keeps me motivated. I am very keen
        to continue working with JavaScript, either building data-rich
        interactive web apps or APIs which solve complex problems, as the
        ecosystem is constantly evolving so there is always something new to
        learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        For front-end code I have recently been using Vue.js and React, and I
        have spent a number of years working with AngularJS. For back-end code I
        often use Node.js with the Express, Koa or Serverless frameworks. I have
        experience using Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, as well
        as working with Docker containers and provisioning bare-metal servers. I
        am also familiar with a variety of databases and file storage
        technologies.
