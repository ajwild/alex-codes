    In recent months I have worked on a small number of tasks for previous
    employers. I have also created a website (ichallenge.club) which
    integrates with the Strava API and allows users to set their own
    running or cycling goals. The primary aim of developing this website
    was to learn new frameworks and improve my knowledge of the AWS
    ecosystem.
