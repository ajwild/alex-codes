  title: I Challenge...
  description:
    In recent months I have created a website (ichallenge.club), which
    integrates with the Strava API and allows users and clubs to set running and
    cycling goals. The primary aim of developing this website was to learn new
    frameworks and improve my knowledge of the AWS ecosystem.

  description:
    I was hired by a university research group to create a new AngularJS user
    interface for the Graasp platform (graasp.eu). I also had to modify the
    platform so that it could be used by Doctors Without Borders Geneva. I
    quickly transitioned into a full stack role and took on further
    responsibilities, including updating and optimising the SpeakUp web app
    (speakup.info). Alongside the development work I would mentor students and
    interns, review the code of team members, and provide time estimates for
    development work. There were also a number of Linux and Mac system
    administration tasks, including migrating the services to new rack servers.

    My first experience of working in a startup was at Amplifier Agency, where I
    worked with a team of developers to create the Shareable Apps platform
    (shareableapps.com). My role was to automate the creation of jQuery Mobile
    web apps using data provided by the authoring platform. We also created a
    number of bespoke web apps for clients.

    While working with the Juggler Design agency (juggler.com.au), I created
    many websites for small businesses. Most of these were built using WordPress
    as the back-end. The majority of the work involved creating new themes based
    on Photoshop templates provided by the graphic designer.

  description:
    At The Safe Shop (now safe.co.uk) I worked in a small team, as the front-end
    developer, on a custom-built PHP website. During my time there we
    redeveloped the whole front-end. Using mock-ups provided by the designer I
    produced a responsive design that integrated with the PHP back-end. I often
    used Photoshop for editing promotional banners and retouching product
    images.
