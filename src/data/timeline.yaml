  title: Senior JavaScript Developer
  subtitle: Control, Vancouver
  description:
    At Control I worked as a full stack developer on a web application which
    aggregated data from multiple payment providers and displayed revenue
    analytics to the user. I was part of a team of approximately ten people,
    and we followed agile development methodologies based around a two week
    release cycle, with group sprint planning and review sessions and daily
    scrum meetings. Shortly after joining I took over the role of lead front-end
    developer, which involved maintaining and developing features for the Vue.js
    website, taking part in feature discussions and UI/UX reviews, and mentoring
    and reviewing the code of other team members. I also spent much of my time
    working on the server API, helping the back-end developers to transition
    from an object oriented JSON API using MySQL and CouchDB to a functional
    REST API using PostgreSQL and Citus.

    I created a website
    ([ichallenge.club](https://www.ichallenge.club/{target_blank})) which
    integrates with the Strava API and allows users and clubs to set running and
    cycling goals. The primary aim of developing this website was to learn new
    frameworks and improve my knowledge of the AWS ecosystem.

    I was hired by a university research group to create a new AngularJS user
    interface for the Graasp platform
    ([graasp.eu](http://graasp.eu/{target_blank})). I also had to modify the
    website so that it could be used by Doctors Without Borders Geneva. I
    quickly transitioned into a full stack role and took on further
    responsibilities, including updating and optimising the SpeakUp web app
    ([speakup.info](http://speakup.info/{target_blank})). Alongside the
    development work I would mentor students and interns, review the code of
    team members, and provide time estimates for development work. There were
    also a number of Linux and Mac system administration tasks, including
    migrating the services to new rack servers.

    was to automate the creation of jQuery Mobile web apps using data provided

    While working with the Juggler Design agency
    ([juggler.com.au](https://juggler.com.au/{target_blank})), I created many
    websites for small businesses. Most of these were built using WordPress as
    the back-end. The majority of the work involved creating new themes based on
    Photoshop templates provided by the graphic designer.

    At The Safe Shop (now [safe.co.uk](https://www.safe.co.uk/{target_blank})) I
    worked in a small team, as the front-end developer, on a custom-built PHP
    website. During my time there we redeveloped the whole front-end. Using
    mock-ups provided by the designer I produced a responsive design that
    integrated with the PHP back-end. I often used Photoshop for editing
    promotional banners and retouching product images.
